    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>khichuri is one of those rare dishes that effortlessly strides the boundary between what’s considered ‘ordinary’ and ‘special’ when it comes to cooking.

        If there is one common thread linking the varied and multitudinous South Asian cuisines, it is khichuri. Essentially a porridge of rice and dal tempered with a handful of spices (that can vary from region to region), khichuri can be as plain or as rich as you want it to be. It ranges from the mild, runny, and carefully spiced version for when you are under the weather, to the steaming and slurpy one for those wistful rainy days, to the thick, gorgeous, ghee-laden offering made to your favourite goddesses during pujo.
        
        Today’s recipe can double as an easy bhog’er khichuri, as well as a delicious, sustaining rainy-day meal. It is made with shona moong—little grains of golden moong dal commonly found in Bengal. The rice used is gobindobhog chaal, a scented, short-grained variety with which polao and payesh are also typically made.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200 g moong dal</li>
            <li>200 g gobindobhog rice</li>
            <li>200 g potatoes (5 cm chunks)</li>
            <li>200 g cauliflower (5 cm florets)</li>
            <li>100 g tomatoes (quartered)</li>
            <li>80 g peas (blanched)</li>
            <li>3 pcs cardamom (whole)</li>
            <li>1 pc cinnamon (whole)</li>
            <li>3 pcs cloves (whole)</li>
            <li>3 pcs dried red chillies</li>
            <li>4 pcs bay leaves</li>
            <li>1.8 litres hot water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>first three Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse gobindobhog rice thoroughly, spread it it over a colander or net, and leave it to air-dry completely.</li>
            <li>Cut potatoes in 5-cm chunks, cauliflower into 5-cm florets, and tomatoes into quarters. Shell and blanch the peas.</li>
            <li>Set a kadai on medium heat and add the moong dal to it. Dry-roast the dal for about 6 minutes or till it turns pinkish-brown giving off a nutty aroma. Stir continuously throughout to get an even roast.</li>
